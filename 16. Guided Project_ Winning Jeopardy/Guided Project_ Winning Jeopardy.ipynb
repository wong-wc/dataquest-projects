    "In this project, let's say we are interested to compete on Jeopardy, which is a popular TV game show in the U.S. where participants answer questions to win money. We are attempting to look for any edge that could help us win. We will be working with a dataset of Jeopardy questions to figure out some patterns in the questions that could help us win. The dataset can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/1uyd0t/200000_jeopardy_questions_in_a_json_file), where each row represents a single question on a single episode of Jeopardy. The accompanying data dictionary is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Show Number` -- the Jeopardy episode number of the show this question was in.\n",
    "* `Air Date` -- the date the episode aired.\n",
    "* `Round` -- the round of Jeopardy that the question was asked in. Jeopardy has several rounds as each episode progresses.\n",
    "* `Category` -- the category of the question.\n",
    "* `Value` -- the number of dollars answering the question correctly is worth.\n",
    "* `Question` -- the text of the question.\n",
    "* `Answer` -- the text of the answer."
