# Dataquest's Projects
These projects are done in chronological order, as part of Dataquest's Data Scientist in Python Path.
Hence, the concepts introduced in these projects gradually increase in complexity.
While there may be better ways to achieve the same output in the earlier projects, the concepts involved in these projects may be introduced in subsequent lessons that are not tied to the current project. For example, using pure Python to manipulate data instead of using NumPy or pandas in the initial projects.
While these projects are guided, little guidance is offered and the entire project was created from the ground-up from scratch on my own. Little to no instructions are often provided as part of these guided projects.

The full list of courses taken under the learning path can be found on my [Dataquest's profile](https://app.dataquest.io/profile/wongweechuan).
